## Output template for Clickbait Agent

This folder contains a strict JSON output template the LLM must conform to when returning analysis results.

Files
- `output_template.json` â€” schema-shaped template with all required keys. Values are intentionally empty or null to avoid anchoring.

Guidelines for integrators and prompts
1. Always pass the template schema to the LLM as an *empty* template (keys present, values empty). Do NOT include example values for `score`, `label`, `rationale`, `signals` or other result fields in the prompt.
2. Before calling the LLM, sanitize the article input payload to remove any prefilled output fields (for example: `score`, `label`, `rationale`, `rationale_user_friendly`, `signals`, `suggestions`, `diagnostics`). See the recommended sanitization function in codebase.
3. If you need to show examples to the LLM for offline calibration, keep those examples outside production prompts. Use a separate offline dataset (e.g., `tests/fixtures/examples.json`) and never include it in production calls.
4. Require the LLM to output EXACTLY the JSON structure of `output_template.json`. Use strict schema validation after generation and reject outputs that omit required fields or return additional top-level analysis values.
5. For semantic hits, require LLM to populate `title_semantic_hits` and `content_semantic_hits` entries as objects with `text` and `confidence` fields and keep `confidence` >= `counting_policy.semantic_confidence_threshold`.
6. Enforce deterministic mode: set `seed` in the system and apply post-processing rounding rules (nearest 5) as described in the spec.

Sanitization checklist (pre-LM)
- Remove: `score, label, rationale, rationale_user_friendly, signals, suggestions, diagnostics` from input article.
- Replace any sample analysis blocks with the empty `output_template.json` if you need to show structure.

Validation checklist (post-LM)
- Verify required fields exist: `id, source, url, score, label, rationale, rationale_user_friendly, signals, suggestions`.
- Validate types and bounds: e.g., `score` in [0,100], `label` one of allowed enums.
- For each field in `signals`, ensure that regex hits are present when claimed and semantic hits include `confidence`.

Why this matters
- Providing an empty, enforced template prevents anchoring and ensures the LLM returns all required fields in a consistent format. Prefilled or example-filled templates can bias outputs.

If you want, I can add a small helper `tools/sanitize_input.py` and update `tools/enforce_output_schema.py` to accept a `--template` flag and reject outputs that diverge from the template. Ask and I'll implement both (with tests).
